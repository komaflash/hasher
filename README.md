# String Hasher

Hasher is a small Sublime Text 2 & 3 Plugin that generates hashes from the selected text and some miscellaneous **Unicode aware** string conversions. Currently supported:

* MD5
* SHA1
* Base64 Encode
* Base64 Decode
* URI Component Encode
* URI Component Decode
* Entity Encode
* Entity Decode
* Unicode Escape
* Unicode Unescape

## Key bindings

Use _Cmd + Shift + P_ on Mac or _Ctrl + Shift + P_ on Windows and type the command you need. Type _hasher_ to see available commands. More to come.

## Hasher commands in the Context Menu

IF you wish to add hasher commands to the context menu, you may add the following to the end of your User/Context.sublime-menu

```
